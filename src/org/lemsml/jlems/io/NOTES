The jlemsio package has dependencies on classes that are incompatible with some applications of the 
core jlems code. 

For pure java environments, jlemsio would normally be included in any build. Other environments, 
such as GWT will need separate implementations of the io logic here.

In particular, anything involving Files, Reflection, Logging, Dates and StreamTokenizers should go in here,
not in jlems.
