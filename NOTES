Compartmental Models

 - Use standard component types to define everything
 - New element, ExternalDynamics that declares the application that will 
   handle the dynamics. This should provide an implementation of a new 
   dynamics interface that handles creating state types and state instances 
   (also with new interfaces?)
 - ext dynamics implementation needs hooks back to normal dynamics to 
   crete subomponents that use standard jlems.
   
   not clear how much the intefaces will need major refactorings elsewhere? 
   Would be nice to make the existing implementation more modular.
